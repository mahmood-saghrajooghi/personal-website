// something that can determine the difference in thinking is the goal that one pursues for that
// thinking. For example, looking back at a work experience, different people will have different
// learnings. This is highly dependent on what goals the have by thinking back on that experience.
// Someone can be looking for an understanding of the whole product creation process, while someone else
// might be looking for an understanding of the technical aspects.
//
// At the moment it is not clear to me on how to set goals for the thinking. I think this might be
// different that setting life goals for example. Some goals in thinking might have better outcomes
// regardless of the goals themselves.

              I'm trying to answer the question "How should you think about deserving something you
              want? What should your reaction be to the following quote?"

              To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. The world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a whole bunch of
              undeserving people.<br />

              Something you need to consider about the quote above is that you should try to avoid
              a situation where you are always trying to deserve something because you don't believe
              you already deserve it. If not, you might end up in a situation where you are always
              in a state of preparation.

              A good example is when you want to get a job at a certain position in a certain company.
              Reading the quote above, you might be like "I'll spend a year preparing for this job".
              Then a year becomes two, and before you know it you have lost the opportunity to apply
              for the job.

              I'm not saying that you shouldn't try to become better. I'm just saying that recognize
              when you <i>do</i> deserve something and <i>go for it</i>. Otherwise you will end up in a state of regret.

              This reminds me of the distinction between regret versus remorse. Regret is when you look
              back and say "I wish I <i>had done</i> ...". Remorse is when you look back and say
              "I wish I <i>hadn't done</i> ...". Do you see the difference? Regret follows inaction, while
              remorse follows action. Thinking about regret, this quote comes to mind:

              Like anything else in life, there should be a balance between preparing to deserve
              something and going for it when the opportunity presents itself.
