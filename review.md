# Review Findings

## Critical Issues

- **High** – `components/gym-graph/GymActivityGraph.tsx:72`: The new color memo uses `localStorage` directly inside render. In the pages router this component still server-renders, so the first request hits `ReferenceError: localStorage is not defined`, taking the whole `/gym` page down. Please guard the access (e.g., `typeof window !== 'undefined'`) and defer the read/write to a client-only effect.
- **High** – `components/glitch/glitch.tsx:19`: The class string now appends `cursor-none!`, which Tailwind won’t recognize. The important modifier has to precede the class name (`!cursor-none`); as written the default cursor remains visible and the custom cursor experience regresses.

## Assumptions / Questions

- I’m assuming the `/pages` router remains SSR; if you’ve intentionally disabled SSR for `/gym`, please call that out because it changes the impact of the `localStorage` issue.

## Context

- Feature adds Supabase-driven gym tracking UI, shadcn components, and Tailwind v4 setup.
